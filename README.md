# express-mongo-showcase
An example repo for anyone who interested to implement express backend with mongodb atlas

## A little bit of Introduction
Okay, so here we go, if you previously see other repo about express+knex, it will only work with SQL. Nowadays, NOSQL is quite popular and it requires different level of knowledge to deal with. So within this repo, I will show you a little something on how to make a backend API that work with MongoDB. This repo mainly use NodeJS+Express+TypeScript+Mongoose

## How To Install
clone this repository and do npm install

## Make Account on MongoDB Atlas
Go to Mongodb and just make account there. For this repo example, I create new database cluster and load one of their template 'sample_mflix'

## How It Works?
Just see comment on each of line of the code, I will try to describe as clear as I can there. And also check Wiki for development/tutorial journey
